# RefiBot

> A small educational robot made from recycled plastic from fishnets

## Structure

The project is structured as:
- `hardware` folder: .stl and .stp files required to build the chasis of the robot.
- `include` folder: the library implemented to control the RefiBot, with the third-parties required to run it.
